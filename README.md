# Prom Pb Client

A Node.js library for writing Prometheus.io clients, based off [metrics.proto](https://github.com/prometheus/client_model/blob/master/metrics.proto) and [protobuf.js](https://github.com/dcodeIO/protobuf.js).

This library includes a minimal protobuf.js stub, with a small set of additional methods.

It also includes a small codebase for launching Exporter servers and setting up export endpoints.
